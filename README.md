# IT Home Lab Portfolio

Hello!

I'm completely new at everything there is to be new about.

So this repo will contain my personal IT projects, home lab setups, and whatever messups and accidental surprises I make along the way.

Feel free to follow along and correct me wherever, whoever you are.

But this will just be me stumbling through and learning ><

Focus areas for my labs at present will be on:


📍 Active Directory

📍 Linux Server

📍 SIEM and Cybersecurity

📍 Virtualised Networking

📍 Cloud and DevOps
